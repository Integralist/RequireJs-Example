	<h1>RequireJS lazy-loading (not *really* lazy-loading)</h1>
	<p>Instead of loading all modules on page load (within the main bootstrap script) you can use require('string-module') within a module to lazy-load more modules.</p>
	<p>The build script will still be able to pick up these other modules - <strong>but remember that although 'during development' you may be lazy loading the scripts, the build script is creating a single file with all your modules included so you aren't *really* lazy-loading once you deploy via the build script</strong>.</p>
	
	<!-- 
		data-main: defines the main script folder where all other scripts are loaded relative to.
		we have specified 'google' to be the script to be loaded initially when DOM is ready.
