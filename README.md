[Integralist](http://www.integralist.co.uk/) - RequireJs/AMD
================================

Description
-----------

Basic RequireJs Example with code comments to explain how everything works.
See a post related to this repo: http://integralist.co.uk/post/11705798780/beginners-guide-to-amd-and-requirejs


Update
-----------

Have started adding more examples (like plugins) to show how they work.

* Async Plugin (helps with loading 3rd party services such as Google Maps and JSONP services - e.g. Twitter feed)
* JSONP (my own attempt at loading JSONP data)
* Template Plugin (uses the same template engine as found in _underscore.js)
* Lazy-Loading (although *not really* when you're deploy via a build script as all modules are concatenated into single script!)
* jQuery Plugins (there are a couple of plugins that our company uses which I'll start porting over to support AMD)
